POPMART,Custom Star Trek outfits,https://reddit.com/r/sylvanianfamilies/comments/1l2m7kl/custom_star_trek_outfits/,These are so good! Shiba Inu is perfect as Spock and biscuit bear is such a cute Kirk.   Now I’m trying to think of who the other characters would be.   Maybe a beagle or chocolate lab for Bones.   Perhaps an alpaca or hedgehog for Uhura. I’m trying to capture her iconic hair.   An otter for Scotty. Because it rhymes and that makes me happy.   The tuxedo cat mom for Sulu. The black spot on the ear reminds me of his hair. Also I loved George Takei as Foie Gras in Chowder.   I want to hear other suggestions.

I will say that I have accessed Pop Mart's website on my laptop but never via the app, so I feel like that should've counted for something?  EDIT: I was just able to successfully check out a 2nd time on the same account, on my own phone that appeared to be shadowbanned. Rather than using the checkout button to reset the timers on my PopNows, I let the timers expire and just re-clicked the reserve button under each of them in my cart and did not try to check out at all for a bit more than 30 minutes. After that time, I attempted to check out and was able to on the first click! Basically, do not check out for 30+ minutes. Refresh timers in the cart ONLY. And then try!"

POPMART,Honestly disgusted,https://reddit.com/r/labubu/comments/1ka3k8r/honestly_disgusted/,"I know it’s a hassle but you need to contact your postmaster. Get them involved and you will see results.   I had terrible experiences with a postman and it got to the point where an item worth over $600 was “lost” it was marked as delivered but it never arrived. I fought with everything until i unknowingly reached the postmaster and BOOM! The postman was replaced and a couple of months later, my packages (granted it was destroyed) appeared but thankfully the item inside was well packaged by sender that it survived whatever abuse it was subjected to. Reach out to your postmaster and I hope your issue gets resolved.  EDIT: I didn’t notice it was UPS and not USPS. Sorry. Still document everything and reach customer service. You need to have a paper trail and like others have suggested. Change the delivery and if it persists with different name and address and it still gets stolen. Then an employee is definitely stalking popmart packages. I also hate how it’s labeled popmart on the box. You’d think they’d hide that information, specially since right now the craze is fervent."

And if this is the reason for their recent price increase I’m totally cool with it since their increase amount is way less than we would pay if we were responsible for the tariffs."
POPMART,Popmart explanantion about tariff concern,https://reddit.com/r/labubu/comments/1k3ngtt/popmart_explanantion_about_tariff_concern/,I’m a logistics manager for a corporation and this probably is true as when you ship internationally you need to make a commercial invoice for customs which designates the importer and who is the responsible party for duties and taxes. Popmart maybe is listing themselves as the importer and you (the customer) as just the cosignee as well as making the duties and taxes the responsibility of the shipper. I have some Labubus on the way so hoping this is the case!

POPMART,Popmart explanantion about tariff concern,https://reddit.com/r/labubu/comments/1k3ngtt/popmart_explanantion_about_tariff_concern/,I’m skeptical because the extra cost may 2nd seems to come from OUR postal service if I’m reading it correctly? Like yeah popmart won’t give us any fees… but ups/fedex etc. are supposed to apparently bill you at delivery. Or hold your items until you pay the US import fee. Popmart is not responsible for that. Our postal system is responsible for collecting it.   example - you pay $35 at popmart for your bubu. Perfect. No extra fees. But then fedex swoops in before delivery and says you owe them $100 package fee. You have now paid $135. Nothing to do with popmart.   Maybe I’m reading it wrong?

POPMART,the popmart community is NOT ok,https://reddit.com/r/PopMartCollectors/comments/1ldcv15/the_popmart_community_is_not_ok/,"Thank you for this articulate post. I truly enjoy my labubus, even having come to the trend earlier this year through hearing about them through influencers, I can honestly say that I am fairly discerning on what I choose to purchase that happens to be on trend. Lisa has also posted photos of other bag charms and other similar products are getting pushed by influencers - I can honestly say I have no interest in a lot of them. I pretty much like labubus and molly. Like, I can't find it in me to like any of the cry babies at all and I think the whole Stanley trend was stupid lol (no hate for people who enjoy these, just personal taste).  I would also consider though that for a lot of us, collecting these are small luxuries (there are other products besides designer toys in this category as well) in our lives. There is a whole generation of us (millennial and younger) who cannot afford, and may never afford, what used to always be the ""big"" goals/luxuries - homes, cars, etc. The mindset being, I earn enough to fulfill all my needs, but even with plenty of savings and salary increases, a home purchase/downpayment is becoming less and less attainable, so I'm going to spend my extra cash to treat myself now with these ""wants"". I don't disagree at all with your post and I recognize all this consumerism is an issue, just adding an additional point that, right or wrong, these small luxuries can bring many a little bit of happiness when the larger world and our future can often look bleak.   Even with all this, I'm getting more and more dissatisfied with Pop Mart as a company and will likely be looking to spend elsewhere."

But it also offers joy, creativity, nostalgia, and community to millions. The solution isn’t to shame collectors or paint them as delusional — it’s to encourage mindful consumption and open conversations around value, not to assume that everyone is duped or lost in capitalist fog.  At the end of the day, there’s room for both critique and joy, both resistance and indulgence. But calling out a community for “not being okay” just because its interests differ from yours risks turning thoughtful consumerism into gatekeeping disguised as righteousness."

I'm fairly certain there are millions of unlicensed sculptures, paintings, etc of Spider-Man of other Disney things. If they aren't planning on selling the tombstone or weren't going (little late now) to advertise this , just commission the tombstone from some local artisan , and no one would have ever known , I don't think Disney has lawyers patrolling cemeteries to ensure these rules are enforced. Also, in an after the fact situation, what are they gonna insist they have the kids tombstone removed / replaced? That would be worse for there image than just saying no"

Disney,Multi-billion dollar corporation Walt Disney stole freelancer's fan art and is selling it in its park,https://reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/szbaq3/multibillion_dollar_corporation_walt_disney_stole/,"I'm gonna leave this as a single comment threat...  I watched the thing, and according to the Video, the Artist Andrew Martin released the 3d model on a ""non-commercial use allowed"" License on Thingyverse, claiming that Disney stole his model.  However, by simply googling for ""3d model tiki drummer"", i also found his 3d model here: https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/vNmO/tiki-drummer-3d-print-stl  On this website, Andrew Martin released the same 3d model under a license, allowing the commercial use of this 3d model on up to 2000 sold items.   I'm not saying Andrew is spilling out false information. I'm just saying that Andrew might have gotten lost where he published his stuff and what licenses he agreed to...  So... take that with a grain of salt.  Edit: And, he is also selling the 3d model for money: https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/BR9a/tiki-drummer-support-the-artist  And looking through his downloads there, he is also selling other IP for money. So, there is that...."
Disney,Multi-billion dollar corporation Walt Disney stole freelancer's fan art and is selling it in its park,https://reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/szbaq3/multibillion_dollar_corporation_walt_disney_stole/,"Ok so, in this case , it's pretty straightforward, I studied image rights when I was doing my masters in fine arts so I'll have a go at this.  &#x200B;  In EU law (which is thankfully pretty similar to the US) The general rule is as follows: In order for an artwork to be under copyright, so seen as legally original, you have to be able to prove the paternity and originality of the artwork. In this case, the design's paternity isn't the 3D-artists', it's disney's Rolly Crump from 1968.It could be argued that the artwork's originality and paternity reside in it being a 3D-model, but that would never stand in court as the original is already a 3D sculpture, and this 3d model is **not transformative enough to be seen as original.**  I'll go as far and say that freely distributing a model based of someone else's is borderline copyright infringement in the first place. When he says ""I didn't want to bother with selling this""; it's because he can't in the first place, disney would be up his ass with lawyers.  Is it crummy from Disney not to credit the guy who made the 3d print from an ethical point of view? Yes. Is it legal for them to do so? Also yes.  Edit: A lot of people are saying that disney doesn't have the right to use the product of his labor for commercial purposes, so I looked a little into it, and boy, it's murky waters:  Copyright law also protects reproduction, in this case, I would argue that this is too close to the original art for it not to be considered a reproduction. So in the first place, the artist doesn't have the right to reproduce Rolly's art. Ok, whatever. The interesting thing here is that Disney ended up using artwork that was created in illegal conditions in the first place but whose design was theirs in the beginning. In the case of counterfeit goods, the police would be required by law to destroy all the goods, in this case, the model would be destroyed. I have no idea if Disney can use a counterfeit product of their own product as their own."

Also, really shitty people go to Disneyland.   I've had families tie their small children to trash cans so they could go on a ride that the child was to small for. I've seen families dump their very disabled, wheelchair bound children off to the side of a walkway with the summer sun beating down so that they could get in a two hour line for a 120 second long ride. I've seen people encourage their kids to shit in the bushes in a line so that they wouldn't have to leave. I've caught adults shitting into plastic bags while in line for Indiana Jones.  People are just the fucking worst.  Edit: this kind of really blew up. I see a few AMA requests and while I do have plenty of stories (and not all of them involve terrible people shitting in places), I'm sure I'm bound by some NDA I signed a decade ago. People are awful, but for the most part the people that work at Disneyland (and Disney World) really do want it to be a magical place. I'll leave this story here to kind of balance things out:  I used to work jungle cruise, and this little girl, who had spent the entire day collecting autographs, accidentally dropped her autograph book in the water. Luckily, the area manager that night had previously been an entertainment manager and part of being an entertainment manager is that you have to memorize every single character's signature.  So we gave the family some re-ads (basically a fast pass for any ride), told them to come back in about an hour because we were calling in all the characters and we were going to have them all sign a new autograph book for her. So while the family was off riding a couple rides, the entertainment manager wrote some personalized messages and autographed the book with every single character's signature.  The little girl was beyond happy, mom was crying, dad was holding the tears back.  It was a pretty great night. Makes up for all the bullshit that can happen sometimes."

I don't think OP is going to deliver LOL   edit: Thread is currently at 25,000 comments, if he bought using the amazon discount (I don't know if they'll even allow this many copies to be bought at once) he could get the games for (31.99) plus tax. all together right now comes up to about 1,000,000.   edit2: So I've done some research and found that nintendo does offer discounts for bulk purchases of their games, you could not order this many any other way. I'm going to estimate because I couldn't find any real numbers but I would guess you could get them at $30 a piece if you ordered the 81,000 that have commented on this thread. I would say you could ship them for $3 a piece, and an addition of 1.59 paid in tax per game (would this be tax deductible? Not sure how that works so I'll include it.) 30+3+1.59=34.59 * 81000 makes the grand total **$2,801,790**  Guys, I think its fair to say OP is kill."

Me and my friends of varying ages and professional/industry levels LOVE Pokemon & Pokemon Go.  That's the beauty of the game, it fits any age group and TBH is one of the friendliest fanfare I ever encountered.  My only complaints is how expensive the merchandise are, esp ones from Japan.  The fact that your friends have the audacity to come to your home or her home and try to put her down, speaks volume of their character.  Good for you you realized this and defended her.   Your GF also sounds like a strong and mature woman who happens to have a hobby.  FYI: Good story about Pokemon-  my friend recently finished her cancer treatments.  Pokemon Go was one of the few games that kept her sane while on chemo. The hospital itself was a gym and she enjoyed her time conquering it."

I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so happy to hear that your son still has such a wonderful mother to lean on.   With that said, I'm gonna drop a Pokemon 101 on you here. Idk your current level of knowledge, so if anything I say is like, ""duh,"" please don't be insulted--just covering all the bases. :)  Also, I'm gonna repeat a lot of what has been said, but I know you're going to get slammed with comments, so I'm hoping to distill most of the important details and consolidate much of the advice into one easy-to-navigate comment.   ----  # Pokémom 101  ## Objectives  All of the [""mainline"" Pokémon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_video_games#Main_series) (as opposed to the various [spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_video_games#Side_games)) share some very basic objectives:  1) **Collect all 8 Gym Badges.** Most towns you travel to in the game will have a [Gym](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gym). There you can challenge the [Gym Leader](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Gym_Leader), a strong trainer that specializes in a certain [Pokémon Type](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Types) who, once defeated, will present you with a [Gym Badge](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Gym_Badges).  2) **Defeat the [Pokémon League](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_League) of this [region](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Regions).** In most games it's an *Elite 4* and then a *Champion*. To do this, you must collect all eight (8) *Gym Badges* and have a strong enough team to face down all five (5) ""bosses"" back-to-back. Once you have beaten the Champion, you become the new Champion of the region and have essentially beaten the game.   3) **Complete the PokéDex (optional).** The PokéDex is an encyclopedia of all the Pokémon in the region, and at the beginning of the game you are tasked with filling it out to assist the [Pokémon Professor](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Professor) that you meet at the beginning of the game. This involves capturing one of each Pokémon in the game. Often times, there is a prize for doing so. At any time, you can view your Pokédex in the pause menu to see which Pokémon you've already encountered and which you've captured.  ----  ## The Story  The story is very simple and all of the mainline games share the same story beats:  * You are a child who comes of age to become a [Pokémon Trainer](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer) and says goodbye to their mother to embark on a journey. * You meet the local Pokémon Professor who gifts you with your [Starter Pokémon](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon) and a PokéDex. * You will meet your hometown [Rival(s)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rival) that you will encounter repeatedly throughout the story--sometimes they are friendly, and other times not, but battling them is a good way to check to make sure your team is strong enough so far. * You travel from town to town capturing new Pokemon, battling trainers, meeting people that you might help out or receive gifts from, and defeating Gym Leaders. * Along the way, you will encounter a mafia- or cult-like organization that you will have to defeat by battling all the way up to the [villainous leader](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Pokemon_Villains). * Eventually, you will defeat the Pokémon League and become the new Champion.  ----  ## Pokémon Training  ### Capturing Wild Pokémon  Wild Pokémon can be obtained by wandering in [Tall Grass](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Tall_Grass) outside of Towns. Once you encounter them, you must battle them to weaken them (use moves that reduce their [HP](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/HP), but don't allow the HP to reach 0, as they will faint and you will not be able to capture them). Once sufficiently weakened, you can throw a [Pokéball](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball) at them. The ball will wiggle momentarily, then settle once they are captured. If they are strong, there is a chance they may break out of the Pokéball, in which case you can try to further weaken them, throw another ball, or throw a stronger ball (such as a Great Ball, Ultra Ball, etc.). Certain balls will be better for catching certain types (for instance, the Net Ball is good for catching aquatic Pokémon).   **Pro Tips:**  * Always stay stocked up on balls! You never know when you'll need one (or ten). Buy more from the local PokéMart whenever you enter a new town. You can also find balls and other items in your travels by searching in trash cans, behind buildings, and exploring to find secret areas. * Remember that damaging Pokémon isn't the only way to weaken them! Some Pokémon on your team can learn moves that will let them put opponents to sleep, paralyze them, etc. * If you're about to encounter a [Legendary Pokémon](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon), save the game before attempting to battle/capture them. This way, if you accidentally make it faint or are unable to capture it, you can turn the game off and turn it back on to have another chance! Generally you only get one shot at capturing a Legendary, and you'll never see them again. * Note that you cannot capture Pokémon that belong to other trainers, only wild ones.   ### Breeding Pokémon  Capturing a Pokémon is not the only way to get new ones! In your travels, you will eventually come across a [Pokémon Daycare](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Day_Care). Here, you can leave up to two Pokémon to be taken care of; however, if you leave two [compatible](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Egg_Groups) Pokémon, they might make an egg! You can then put that egg in your [party](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Party) and carry it around with you until it hatches.   People usually use this method to get Pokémon with better stats than the ones they've seen in the wild, but this gets pretty advanced. Your son probably won't be trying to get Pokemon with [Perfect IVs](https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-bdsp-breeding-perfect-iv-nursery/) or do any [shiny hunting](https://bulbahandbook.bulbagarden.net/pokemonsunmoon/guide/shiny-hunting), so you don't have to worry about learning this stuff, but if he ever wants to, there are tons of excellent guides out there that make it easy. :)  ### Leveling Pokémon  As you battle with your Pokémon, they will gain XP (Experience Points). Once they have enough XP, they will gain a level. The higher a Pokémon's level, the stronger they are.   To level up your Pokémon, you can use them in battle (in Diamond and Pearl, all the Pokémon in your party gain XP when battling), or you can use an item called a [Rare Candy](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Rare_Candy) to instantly raise them up one level (these can be found hidden around the world).  ### Evolving Pokémon  Each Pokémon has unique evolve conditions. Some evolve at a certain level, some evolve with a special [Elemental Stone](https://pokemondb.net/evolution/stone), some only evolve by [trading them](https://pokemondb.net/evolution/trade), and some don't evolve at all. If you want to figure out what a certain Pokemon needs to evolve, search them on the [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/). For example, if you [search ""Charmeleon""](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/charmeleon) and scroll down a little on his page, you can see an ""Evolution chart"" that tells you that he will evolve into Charizard once he reaches Level 36.   ----  ## Pokémon Battles  Pokémon Battles are all about strategy and knowing about effective match-ups. Your opponent will send out a Pokémon, and you should match it with a Pokémon that you know can beat it. There are a few factors to consider:  **1) Level**: Your Pokémon's level should be close to theirs. Ideally, higher. But sometimes you get stuck in a situation where you've gotta battle someone stronger, so just make sure you're using a well-leveled Pokémon. Or, if you keep losing, you may need to go out and do some more training, then come back and battle them again.  **2) Type**: Type is important. There are some obvious ones, like Water beats Fire, Ground beats Electricity, etc., but then there are less obvious ones, like Steel beats Fairy. It can be super hard to remember all the type advantages. Luckily, the newer games will tell you when you're in a battle which moves are effective and which aren't, but I also love to reference this [Type Chart](https://pokemondb.net/type). Here's a [printable version](https://img.pokemondb.net/images/typechart.png). This is very, very handy.  **3) Stats**: All Pokémon have unique stats. Some of them have really good defense, other have really good attack, some are really fast, etc. Keeping these in mind can be handy. You may need a chance to heal a strong Pokémon, so maybe you could swap out a Pokémon with high defense that can take a beating for a couple rounds while you give your star a Super Potion, or maybe your opponent is really quick, but you know your Pikachu is faster, so you can send him out and he'll be able to attack before the opponent gets a chance. You can see all of your Pokémon's stats in the pause menu.   ----  ## Finding Things  You'll probably get questions from him like, ""where do I get X item?"" or ""How can I find X Pokémon?"". This one's easy.   * [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/) * [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/) * [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page)  You can search any item, Pokémon, town, Gym leader, or ANYTHING you might need to know, and it will be on these sites. They are so, so wonderfully handy.   ----  Best of luck, mom! You got this! Remember to save the game *often* and if you ever have questions, you can DM me. :)"

It became hard to remember him clearly after a few years, but luckily my mom took all of his games/consoles/everything and put them in a safe space for me to reopen when I was ready. Playing on his accounts is the only time I really get to feel like I’m with him again and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.

Pokemon,I made pokeball hot chocolate bombs with homemade marshmallows inside,https://reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/kiv2cq/i_made_pokeball_hot_chocolate_bombs_with_homemade/,"My GF made me these and i didn’t listen to her instructions about warming up milk to melt it. The next day I just bit into the chocolate ate the marshmallow inside and enjoyed the crystallized sugar but it was soo messy to eat and i could only eat the powder with the last bites of the bottom of the ball.  After i told her it was great but the powder was a mess, she told me the instructions again and said you just ate it from the fridge?  The laughs i had when i realized i wasn’t supposed to just eat the chocolate but melt it in milk because the powder was to turn it into hot cocoa... hahahaha"
